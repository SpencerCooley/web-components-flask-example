# leaflet-map

*leaflet-map* is a web-component which provides access to the [leaflet map](http://leafletjs.com) 
JavaScript library via html elements.

Please have a look at the [demo page](https://nhnb.github.io/leaflet-map/leaflet-map/demo.html) or the [api documentation](https://nhnb.github.io/leaflet-map/doc.html#leaflet-map).

Most of the options documented in the Leaflet reference are exported as html attributes. 
All events are mapped into html events of the same name.</p>
For example use &lt;leaflet-map latitude="51.505" longitude="-0.09" zoom="13"&gt; &lt;/leaflet-map&gt; 
to define the view and zoom level.


Web-components are an emerging standard which is based on Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, HTML Imports and Web Animations.
[Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/tutorial/intro.html) is a library which simplifies working with web-components. It includes a compatibility layer for browsers which
do not yet support web-components natively, yet.


## Quickstart Guide

Make leaflet maps using declarative [Polymer](http://polymer-project.org) web components.
To get started read the [documentation](http://nhnb.github.io/leaflet-map/doc.html)
or checkout the [demo](http://nhnb.github.io/leaflet-map/).

Install this web component using [Bower](http://bower.io):

```
bower install leaflet-map
```

Import the main component and start creating your map:

```html
  <head>
    <script src="../platform/platform.js"></script>
    <link rel="import" href="leaflet-map.html">
    <style>
      html, body {
        margin: 0;
        height: 100%;
      }
      leaflet-map {
        height: 100%;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body unresolved>
    <leaflet-map longitude="77.2" latitude="28.4" zoom="12">
      <leaflet-marker longitude="77.2" latitude="28.4">
        Marker I
      </leaflet-marker>
      <leaflet-circle longitude="77.2" latitude="28.4" radius="300">
        Round
      </leaflet-circle>
    </leaflet-map>
  </body>
```

Please have a look at the [change log](https://github.com/nhnb/leaflet-map/blob/master/CHANGES.md), for recent developments.

## Dependencies

leaflet-map depends on Polymer in ../platform and ../polymer and it expects an installation of leaflet in ../leaflet.

Please note that the pages have to be accessed via a webserver. file://-urls are not supported.


## Notes for implementing child elements

Child elements like markers or layers will be initialized by the surrounding container (the map or a layer)
by setting a "container" javascript property.
Therefore the child element should define a containerChanged method and use that as initializer. 
Don't forget to define a detached method to support removal of elements. The leaflet-marker element is a good template.
